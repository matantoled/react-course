////// ways to import/export data //////////

// first way: simple
export let apiKey = 'wsadwasdawd';

// second: when you want to export only one thing
export default "wwwww";
// export default "123"; => can't be done bcs we have one already

// third: we can export multiple variables:
export let abc = "abc";
export let def = "def";


// third 2.0 : we can export multiple variables and the import side will receive this in one package
export let firstName = "Matan";
export let lastName = "Toledano";
export let ID = 123456;
